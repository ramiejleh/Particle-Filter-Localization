# Overview
This repository contains all the of the final project for the Localization course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project you I implemented a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. It is given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter also gets observation and control data.

## Running the Code
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory.

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

## Success Criteria
If your particle filter passes the current grading code in the simulator (you can make sure you have the current version at any time by doing a `git pull`), then you should pass!

The things the grading code is looking for are:


1. **Accuracy**: your particle filter should localize vehicle position and yaw to within the values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`.

2. **Performance**: your particle filter should complete execution within the time of 100 seconds.
